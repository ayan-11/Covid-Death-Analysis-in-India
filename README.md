# COVID-19 Impact Analysis in Indian States

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on different states in India. The analysis utilizes Python and Matplotlib for data visualization. The primary focus is on exploring patterns, trends, and variations in COVID-19 cases across various Indian states.

## Dataset

Describe the dataset you are working with, including its source, format, and key features. For example:

- **Source:** The dataset is sourced from (https://tinyurl.com/u5india).
- **Source:** The dataset is also created by eliminating unnecessary features that are hampering the analysis.
- **Format:** It may be in CSV, JSON, or another format.

## Setup

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayan-11/Covid-Death-Analysis-in-India.git
   cd Covid-Death-Analysis-in-India
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the COVID-19 dataset for Indian states and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Covid Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Visualizations

Matplotlib is extensively used to create visualizations. Examples of plots include line charts, bar graphs, choropleth maps, and pie charts. These visualizations aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 impact on Indian states.
